Welcome to Math-Hub by Krutik Chaudhary B00929397 

Today we will solve basic math word problems 

Question 1: James bought 30 mangos for his friends, he realised there are not enough mangos!!! 
So he went to market and bought 40 apples. How many total fruits does James have? 

To find out total number of fruits we need to do addition 
Total number of mangos with James are:30
Total number of apple with James are:40
So, Total fruits is Mangos + Apples = 30+40 = 70

Question 2: James has now 70 fruits, he has to give those fruits to 35 friends 
How many fruits will each of his friends get? 

We need to use division to find out 

We will divide total number of fruits by total number of friends 
Fruit per friend = Total fruits/total friends 
Fruit per friend = 70/35= 2
