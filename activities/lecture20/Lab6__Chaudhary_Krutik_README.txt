## Getting Started

for activity 20, I am resubmitting lab6, for which I recieved 0/10 because my code was not working on timberlea.
I HAVE ALSO COMPLETED THE BONUS PORTION FOR THE LAB6 IN THIS ACTIVITY.

feedback given by the marker was following: 

"I tried to login with different credentials such as Nilesh1802,nilesh.gupta@dal.ca,nilesh as username and password as Gohan1802#, Gotenks1802#,12345688 but was unable to login to the application to view the cart. Hence 0 marks. If you are able to provide me with the correct credentials. Please reach out to me on below email"
